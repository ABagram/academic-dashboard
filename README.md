### About
- This is a project that attempts to limit test the capabilities of AI in web development as well as understanding human language (English). That said, the website is being developed by AI (Copilot) while the design, features, and functionality are all from @ABagram. In later backend developments, the creator may need to intervene to improve the site's reliability.
